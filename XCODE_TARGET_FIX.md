# PalChi iOS Project Fix

## Issue
The build system is trying to compile iOS storyboards for macOS target, causing the error:
```
iOS storyboards do not support target device type "mac"
```

## Root Cause
Even though we removed macOS from Package.swift, the Xcode project configuration still has macOS target settings.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Xcode Project Settings Fix
1. Open PalChi project in Xcode
2. Select the project (top-level "PALCHI") in the navigator
3. Go to Build Settings tab
4. Search for "Supported Platforms" and ensure it only shows iOS
5. Search for "Base SDK" and ensure it's set to iOS
6. Check Deployment Target is set to iOS 13.0 (not macOS 10.13)

### Solution 2: Clean Project Recreation
If the above doesn't work, the project may need to be recreated as iOS-only:

1. Create new iOS project in Xcode
2. Copy source files to new project
3. Add Core Data model
4. Configure build settings properly

### Solution 3: Remove Storyboard (Programmatic UI)
Since the app uses UIKit programmatically, we can remove the storyboard entirely:

1. Delete LaunchScreen.storyboard
2. Update Info.plist to remove storyboard reference
3. Create programmatic launch screen

## Immediate Fix Commands

### Check current target configuration:
```bash
# In Xcode, check these settings:
# Project Settings > Build Settings > Base SDK = iOS
# Project Settings > Build Settings > Supported Platforms = iOS
# Target Settings > Deployment Info > Target = iOS 13.0
```

### Alternative: Remove storyboard dependency
If storyboard continues to cause issues, we can eliminate it entirely.
